Now it will report only the current mode. conservation mode enabled displays max lifespan mode. conservation mode disable display full capacity mode.

Now it will report only the current mode. battery_life_extender mode enabled, displays max lifespan mode. battery_life_extender mode disable, display full capacity mode.
