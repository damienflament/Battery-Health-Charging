## Translation

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this project. There are two straightforward ways to create or update translations for your language:
1. Using the `crowdin` website.
2. Locally using the `Poedit` software.

## Translation on Crowdin

[<img src="./assets/images/translation/crowdin-logo.png" width="40%" target="_blank">](https://accounts.crowdin.com/register)

* Registering a free account on the Crowdin website is required.
* Once your account registration is completed, Crowdin becomes easier to use as it provides several suggestions.

{: .note }
> * This repository's GitHub Action automatically exports the `Battery-Health-Charging.pot` file to Crowdin as soon as the POT file is pushed to GitHub. Therefore, the source on Crowdin is always updated.
> * This repository's GitHub cannot import translations from Crowdin. Consequently, upon completing the translation, contributors will need to manually upload files using a GitHub pull request.
> * I do not receive notifications from Crowdin, so please communicate any queries using GitHub issues.
