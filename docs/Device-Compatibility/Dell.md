# Dell

## Capability
* 3 presets: Full Capacity Mode, Balance Mode, and Maximum Life Span mode.
* 2 additional modes: Express Mode and Adaptive mode.
* Default threshold values of these 3 preset modes are set at 100/95%, 80/75%, and 60/55%.
* Each preset end threshold value can be customized between 100-80 %, 85-65 %, and 85-55 % respectively.
* Each preset start threshold value can be customized between is 95-75 %, 80-60 %, and 80-50 % respectively.
* The difference between end and start threshold cannot be less than 5%.

{: .warning }
Use of `Express` mode may cause battery health to diminish more quickly.

## Dependencies
* There are two available packages for Dell laptop to control charging threshold / mode. **<span style="color:#0e755f">Libsmbios</span>** and **<span style="color:#213c8b">Dell command configure (cctk)</span>**

{: .new-title }
> libsmbios:
>
> * Open source and was the first module developed by open source community for dell laptops.
> * Available with your distro's package manager.
> * The extension will use the `smbios-battery-ctl` module from libsmbios to change threshold/mode.
> * More information check the link below:<br><https://github.com/dell/libsmbios>


{: .note-title }
> Dell command configure:
>
> * Close source and was the later developed by Dell.
> * distributed by Dell and is available at link below:<br><https://www.dell.com/support/kbdoc/en-us/000178000/dell-command-configure>

* For some Dell model, libsmbios works well but Dell command configure doesn't and for others Dell laptops Dell Command Configure works well, but libsmbios doesn't.
* It is entirely up to the user to choose which package to use and test if it works.
* If both package are installed, the extension will detect and give an option to choose the package the extension should use to interact.

## Detection

{: .new-title }
> libsmbios
>
> This Extension will check if the module `smbios-battery-ctl` from **libsmbios** is installed at the default location.<br>`/usr/sbin/smbios-battery-ctl`


{: .note-title }
> Dell Command Configure
>
> This Extension will also check if **Dell Command Center** is installed at the default location.<br>`/opt/dell/dcc/cctk`

* If the extension find any one module installed (`smbios-battery-ctl or cctk`), it will use that module to change mode/threshold
* If the extension finds both `smbios-battery-ctl and cctk` modules installed, it will display an option to choose the package to use for changing threshold/mode as shown below.

## Testing charging threshold using command-line

{: .new-title }

> Require root privileges

> It is possible to set charging mode or threshold using one or two command in `terminal`.
> Command below are helpful :
> * Prior to installing extension, to check compatibility.
> * During debugging, to check if threshold can be applied and read using command-line correctly.
> * Incase user decides to not use extension and prefer changing via command-line.
>
> Note `sudo` also can be used in place of `pkexec` in the below commands as both `sudo` and `pkexec` can be use to run commands in root mode. To make use of polkit rules, the extension uses `pkexec`.

## Validate using Bios Password (Dell Command Configure Only)

{: .note-title }
> Dell Command Configure
>
> * If changing mode or threshold needs to be validated by using BIOS password, it can be enabled in Extension Preference, Under Dell Tab.<br>
> * When `Need bios password to change mode/threshold` is turned on, and option will appear to enter bios password.<br>
> * Entering the bios password will store it in Gnome Keyring, which will be used by the extension whenever mode or threshold is changed.<br>
> * When `Need bios password to change mode/threshold` is turned off, it will clear/delete the stored bios password from Gnome Keyring.<br>
>

{: .warning }
If decision has been made to uninstall and not use this extension, users that have used Bios password to validate changing mode / threshold are recommended to turn off `Need bios password to change mode/threshold`. This will remove/delete the saved bios password in Gnome Keyring.
