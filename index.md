**Battery Health Charging is a Gnome Extension that provides a graphical user interface for setting a laptop's charging limit (charging threshold) within a Gnome environment.**
<br>
<br>
When users keep their laptop connected to an AC adapter all the time, the battery often remains in a high-power state (98-100%) for extended periods, which can reduce battery life. To prevent this reduction in battery life, laptop manufacturers provide an option to limit the battery's charging to a level that prolongs its lifespan (charging threshold). The Battery Health Charging extension offers a Graphical User Interface to set these charging limits/thresholds.

This extension allows you to set 2 or 3 preset modes of threshold (depending on the laptop model):
* **Full Capacity Mode:** The battery is charged to its full capacity for longer use on battery power (when the charger is unplugged).

* **Balanced Mode:** Stops charging when the battery level is around 80%. This mode is recommended when using the laptop on battery power, such as during meetings or conferences.

* **Maximum Lifespan Mode:** Stops charging when the battery level is around 60%. This mode is recommended when the laptop is always powered by an AC adapter.

The battery level at which charging stops (charging threshold) may differ on some laptop models.
